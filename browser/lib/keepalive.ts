// Keepalive tracking for the background context (extension.md §Messaging,
// transport.md §Per-browser lifetime).
//
// Two jobs, both keyed off "is capture live" (≥1 live participant across all
// connected pcm ports):
//
//   1. chrome.alarms keepalive. Chrome's MV3 service worker suspends after
//      ~30 s idle. WebSocket *activity* resets that timer (Chrome 116+), but a
//      call where nobody talks produces no PCM frames and EarsSocket sends
//      nothing during silence — so a long quiet stretch could still suspend
//      the worker mid-call. While capture is live we keep a periodic alarm
//      whose firing both resets the idle timer and, if the worker did die,
//      respawns it. The alarm is cleared the moment the last participant
//      leaves, so an idle extension (meeting tab open but no call) schedules
//      no wakes at all. On Firefox the background page is persistent and the
//      alarm is a harmless no-op.
//
//   2. storage.session recovery state. A respawned worker re-runs its module
//      top level, which already reconnects EarsSocket and re-opens streams
//      lazily on the next PCM frame — but it has lost the in-memory fact that
//      capture was live, so without this it would also fail to re-arm the
//      keepalive alarm until audio happens to flow again. restore() reads the
//      persisted state at startup and re-arms. storage.session (not .local)
//      because this state must die with the browsing session — a fresh browser
//      start has no live ports and must not resurrect a stale alarm.
//
// Naming note: "session" in this file only ever means the chrome.storage.session
// browser API (storage scoped to the browsing session) — it is unrelated to any
// session concept of our own.
//
// Participants are tracked per-port so a closing tab (port disconnect) can
// return its still-live participants — the caller closes their ingest streams,
// otherwise a mid-call tab close would leak open streams on earsd until the
// socket next reconnects.

// decision consumes, and every decision taken, as one typed, timestamped,
// versioned event stream (docs/plans/attribution-refactor.md R1). Recorded
// per-call in the browser, exportable on demand, and — when a daemon session
// exists — appended by earsd to `sessions/<id>/attribution.jsonl` beside
// `events.jsonl`.
//
// This module is the pure half (tier-0 per docs/engineering-practices.md):
// event types, the line encoder/decoder, and a bounded ring. No DOM, no
// postMessage, and no clock reads — `t` is always supplied by the caller. The
// effectful half (the shared per-call ring on `window`, batching to the
// daemon) lives in attribution-recorder.ts.

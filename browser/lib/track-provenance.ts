// ── Track provenance: local/remote lineage for the webaudio seam ────────────
//
// The webaudio-track seam self-discovers anonymous tracks, and Meet's WebAudio
// graph carries the user's own outgoing audio alongside remote participants —
// on the 2026-08-05 call three of six adopted tracks were the local mic, so
// every utterance landed in the transcript four times. Provenance classifies a
// track from the page's own API contract, never from signal analysis: a track
// handed out by getUserMedia/getDisplayMedia or handed to a sender is local by
// construction; a track delivered by `ontrack` is remote; a clone inherits its
// parent; a track that reports a capture device in getSettings() is local
// (`classifyOnSight`, the signal that survives when the hook installed too late
// to witness any of the above). Everything else stays unknown — and unknown
// ADOPTS (capture-seams.ts policy): a wrongly dropped remote track is
// unrecoverable data loss, a missed local one only a transcript-quality bug, so
// classification can only fail safe.
//
// Classification is a picture that only improves, never a one-shot decision:
// a track can arrive unclassified and be named local later, when the page
// hands it to a sender. `seamTracksToRetire` is what acts on that — the
// 2026-08-06 call adopted the local mic as unknown and, because provenance was
// read once at adoption, kept capturing the user for the whole 42 minutes.
//
// Realm-global like __earsLiveTracks, so re-injected epochs share one lineage.
// Reads and writes never enumerate getSenders()/getReceivers() — only the
// page's own calls are observed (the constraint at the top of this file).

// frame sources feed the same downstream logic (frame-pipeline.ts /
// meet-decode.ts): MediaStreamTrackProcessor for Zoom/Teams, and an

// is ever connected to an AudioContext destination: no playback, no feedback

// policies is itself constructible in a test with fakes (finding F1). One
// production instance per module instance (i.e. per injected epoch's realm
// module), holding exactly the state the old module-level `let`s held.

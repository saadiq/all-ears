// call: each remote participant arrives as an ordinary RTP receiver track,
// which Daily attaches to one of a pool of pre-created `<audio>` elements, and
// the receiver-track seam captured it (`browser:web:t1` reached earsd before
// this platform existed and was refused for want of a session).

// Identity is not solved: `identify()` returns null, so sources stay
// `browser:daily:t<n>`. Daily's own globals (`_daily`,
// `placeDailyContextOnWindow`) may expose the participant list — unexplored.

// Teams' *external* meeting id — the chat thread the call hangs off,
// `19:meeting_<48 chars>@thread.v2`. It is handed to `session.start` as
// `external_id` and nothing else; the daemon mints its own session UUID from
// it (same contract as Meet's <space> and Zoom's numeric id).
//
// Unlike Zoom, this cannot be read off the URL. On the anonymous join path
// (teams.microsoft.com/light-meetings/launch?anon=true&lightExperience=true)
// the URL carries no thread id at all — only tenant/object ids that repeat
// across every meeting from one organiser, and per-session correlation ids
// that would fragment one meeting across rejoins (journal #161). The thread id
// *is* present in the document, so this needs a Meet-style poll: scrape, stop
// on first resolve.
//
// ── SURFACES, CHEAPEST FIRST ────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Serialising the whole DOM once a second is not free on an SPA the size of
// Teams. Measured in Chromium on a synthetic 30k-element / 3.9 MB document:
//
//     documentElement.innerHTML + regex     4.9  ms
//     documentElement.textContent + regex   0.09 ms   (55x cheaper)
//     location.href + regex                 free
//
// — and ~4 MB of garbage per serialise besides. So the surfaces are tried in
// cost order and the expensive one is rate-limited to one poll in five:
//
//   1. `url` — free, and authoritative when present. The signed-in client
//      routes calls by thread id (`#/l/meetup-join/19:meeting_…@thread.v2`),
//      which the anonymous light client does not. UNVERIFIED against a live
//      signed-in call; it costs one regex against a short string, and a miss
//      just falls through.
//   2. `documentText` — every text node, which includes the contents of inline
//      `<script>` config blobs. Misses attribute values.
//   3. `documentHtml` — full markup, the only surface that sees attributes.
//      Last resort, rate-limited.
//
// Resource-timing URLs (`performance.getEntriesByType("resource")`) were
// considered as a fourth surface and dropped: #161 already places the id in
// the document, so it buys no coverage, and the caller only polls at all while
// a peer connection is live, which is what actually bounds the cost.
//
// Known weakness: on the full client the chat rail stays mounted during a
// call, so surfaces 2-3 can in principle see *another* meeting's thread id.
// The URL is checked first for exactly that reason. Not observed; worth a
// live confirmation before leaning on it.

// that update comparison ignores.
//
// Which build is loaded is worth showing, because loading the wrong one fails
// *silently*: `wxt build` writes static content_scripts into the manifest,
// while a `wxt` dev build registers them at runtime and needs the dev server
// on :3000. Without it the service worker still starts and still holds its
// earsd sockets, so every surface looks healthy while nothing is ever injected
// into a meeting tab (diagnosed 2026-09-04, after it cost two days of calls).
// The extensions management page (chrome://extensions, brave://extensions)
// shows version_name in place of version, so it now names the build outright.

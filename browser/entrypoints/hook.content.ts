// MAIN-world hook. Registered as a content script so the browser runs it at
// document_start, in the page realm, BEFORE any page script — no fetch race.
// This is what wins the constructor race against Zoom's bootstrap caching
// (verified: injectScript's async <script src> lost that race; see journal).
// The isolated-world relay lives in content.ts.
//
// Capture on/off gate (Phase 7). The toggle lives in storage.local
// (capture-toggle.ts), which this MAIN-world script cannot read — so the hook
// installs unconditionally (passive: it only registers tracks, captures
// nothing) and capture WAITS for content.ts to post the persisted toggle
// state across the world boundary as a `capture-state` control message.
// Chosen over the alternatives because:
//   - The hook must install at document_start regardless of the toggle: if it
//     skipped installation while off, toggling ON mid-call could never work
//     (the page has long since cached the native constructor — Zoom-style).
//     With the hook always resident, enabling capture just starts an epoch,
//     which adopts the hook's live-track registry — mid-call ON is seamless.
//   - Waiting for the async storage read costs nothing: startEpoch() replays
//     liveTracks() on start, so tracks arriving before the state message are
//     picked up then, not lost.
// Toggling OFF claims a fresh epoch WITHOUT starting capture on it: every
// existing pipeline's isCurrentEpoch() check goes false (no new tracks) and
// the superseded epoch's teardown stops the live ones — the exact same
// supersede path a re-injection uses, no new machinery in audio-tap.ts.
